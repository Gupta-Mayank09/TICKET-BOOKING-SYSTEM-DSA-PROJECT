# TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM-DSA-PROJECT
🧾 Project Description

This project is a simple Ticket Booking System implemented in C using the concept of queues. It simulates how customers book tickets, get added to a queue, and how cancellations update the queue in real time. The system allows users to book a ticket by entering their name, cancel a specific ticket number, and view the current waiting queue.
The project demonstrates core data structure operations such as enqueue, dequeue, checking empty/full queue, and shifting elements after cancellation. It is designed for beginners to understand queue implementation in C while simulating a real-world use case of ticket management.

🔍 Algorithmic Concepts Used
✔ 1. Queue Data Structure
✔ 2. Linear Queue Implementation
✔ 3. Searching Algorithm (Linear Search)
✔ 4. Shifting Algorithm (for cancellation
✔ 5. Input Handling + String Operations

✅ Functionalities of the Ticket Booking System
